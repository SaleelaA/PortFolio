	<p>	A strong passion and an ambition to create a mark in the Computer field made me decide to a master’s program that would broaden my horizons after completion of my Bachelor’s in Information Technology. With a natural flair for mathematical computing, I have been interested in problem-solving from a very young age. </p>
		
	<p>	With an inventive spirit since childhood, I have always enjoyed dabbling with computers and experimenting with different applications. Because my own life has essentially coincided with the rise of the modern computing industry, I can sense that there are still tremendous developments to come in this field. Wanting to explore further during high school I embarked upon learning C & HTML in its rudimentary stage, which left me thirsting for more knowledge gain in this field!</p>

	<p>Being an Information Science Graduate I have obtained exceptional technical skills in the subjects like Web development, Database Management, Advanced Programming and Network Security and also gained profound knowledge in many programming languages in Java, C#,JAVASCRIPT,ASP.NET.        
		
		Based on my technical abilities I was given an opportunity to work on campus simultaneously as Teaching Assistant through which I was able to assist various students understanding concepts and clarify their doubts in subjects like ASP.NET, ERP, and C#.</p>
		
	<p>The ability to develop something creative and amazing is something that fascinates me about Web Development. This interest in Web Designing and Development made me acquire complete practical Knowledge about it. Building a state of the art, an easy-to-use user-friendly website is truly a passion of mine.
		
		I have pursued my passion ever since and continuously strived to gain and improve my knowledge throughout all aspects of the web. With My dedication to self-improvement in web design and development, I was able to develop few dynamic responsive websites using technologies like JQUERY, ANGULARJS, ANGULAR 5 etc.</p>
		
	<p>The job of a Web designer is thrilling as well as adventurous because very often there is a new update in the technologies which might be more flexible and useful. With my constant thirst for knowledge, I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on technological advancements, which is an important factor for me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver my exceptional work.</p>
		
<p>		Being a detail-oriented person, I organize my work and time efficiently. I strongly believe my passion towards this industry and my optimistic personality makes me unique. I want to make more of an impact rather than just doing my job. I am confident that not only I would blend in with the company but also would be an excellent addition to your organization.	</p>
